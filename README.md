# Dxm Mobile Flashcards

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
For general information on how to perform common tasks, see the [create-react-native-app guide](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).

# Overview

This is a simple mobile flashcard app for Android (not tested on iOS).
It allows users to study collections of flashcards. 
The app allows users to create different categories of flashcards called "decks", 
add flashcards to those decks, then take quizzes on those decks.

On first start, a demo deck is provided. 
Once you create decks yourself, the demo deck will be no longer available.

# Getting started

## Local development and testing

First, install the [Expo app](https://expo.io) on your mobile device. 
Connect your mobile device to your computer using a cable (you need to enable USB debugging),
OR make sure it is in the same network as your computer.

After that, if you have yarn installed (currently preferred for react native), simply start the app by
```
yarn
yarn start
# or, if you want to use npm
npm install
npm start
```
Then, after the packager is ready, type 'a' in the console. Expo should open your app now.
Once the app is up, shake your phone to get a lot of nice options for debugging etc.
 
## Running the app locally 
```
yarn android
# or, if you want to use npm
npm run android
```

## Installing the app from the app store
Coming Soon(TM)
